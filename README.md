# Convective-heat-transfer-from-a-flat-plate
The flow solution is obtained from the previous project.
Hence, flow in the domain is defined.
Then the energy equation is solved over the plate.
Further, the boundary conditions are applied.
A mapping algorithm is used to march the boundary conditions from plate surface to far field.
The algorthm is solved until the boundary conditions are matching.
Finally, the thermal boundary layer constant is displayed for the current Pr number. 
Also, the dimensionless temperature from wall and the thermal boundary layer are plotted.

Thanks
